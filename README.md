Users & Passwords
================

The Galaxy Admin User has the username ``admin@galaxy.org`` and the password ``admin``.
The PostgreSQL username is ``galaxy``, the password is ``galaxy`` and the database name is ``galaxy`` (I know I was really creative ;)).
If you want to create new users, please make sure to use the ``/export/`` volume. Otherwise your user will be removed after your docker session is finished.


Requirements
============

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/)


Restarting Galaxy
=================

If you want to restart Galaxy without restarting the entire Galaxy container we can use `docker exec` (docker > 1.3).

```docker exec <container name> supervisorctl restart galaxy:```
